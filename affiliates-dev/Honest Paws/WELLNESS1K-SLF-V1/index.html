              <p class="font-normal text-medium">Fortunately, the lumps were benign, but they were still causing Milo a great deal of discomfort. He had several of the lumps removed, but due to medical complications, removing any new lumps became impossible.</p>
              <p class="font-normal text-medium">That's a hard pill for any pet parent to swallow. They couldn't do anything about the lumps, but luckily, there was something they could do to manage Milo's discomfort.</p>
